# DPKG-DEB-BUILDER

Here are some .Deb Builds for some Programms.

# Why?
I just hate it when Programms can't be Installed easily over APT or Other PKG Programms.
The Goal is that you just can Install and Uninstall it.

# Programm Deb List

1. Pi-Apps Original Project: https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps




# Warning/Note/Info
Note for Pi-apps Deb: The pi-apps deb is designed to run under *Raspberry Pi OS*. It's not working under Ubuntu.
You will get: 1. Perimission Error. No Access. You need to run this at Root, but Pi-Aps don't like Root
2. It will faile to fetch updates. It can't access his own Dictonary! It will Open, but no Apps
